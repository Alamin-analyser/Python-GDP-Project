## Data Analysis and Visualisation in Python

**Please download the ‘GDP (nominal) per Capita.csv’ dataset  [here.](https://justit831-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/danpe_justit_co_uk/EV1Xzb5eNENHmOVMDssxyoMBqTCVcLg18U4qOLUDZZHSkw?e=PAbKfN)**

In this project, we used Python to extract and analyse specific data from the 'GDP (Nominal) per Capita.csv' dataset. Our first step was to load the data from the CSV file into a DataFrame named "df" using Colab notebook. To quickly explore the dataset, we printed the first 10 rows, providing a snapshot of the data.

The Syntax and output are shown below
